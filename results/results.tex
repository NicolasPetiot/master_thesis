	\caption{MSA, each line of this matrix corresponds to a given sequence of interest and each column gives the aligned residue that is associated to this sequence. Amino-acids that have been identified as part of the interface of dimerization in the AlphaFold structures are displayed in red upper case. Amino-cadis that have been identified as part of the binding site in the AlphaFill structure are displayed in green.}

The figure (\ref{MSA matrix}) represents the computed sequence alignment obtained with the $25$ GSTs.
