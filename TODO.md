In introduction :
Add picture of catalytic cycle + evolution tree for GSTs of class Delta and Epsilon (fig1.pdf)

In material and methods :
Create a big sample of MSA to highlight the conservation of some residues
Fix the display of Angstr√∂m

In Results :
modify the MSA matrix to add the known residues that bellongs to BS.
